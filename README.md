TCP is a great protocol. It allows for seamless communication of data. So I thought, why not make a chatting software server and client similar to Discord with it?

And thus, XZChat was born. It started off with just a simple C language only implementation, but now, we have cross platform support!

The server software can be found [here](https://github.com/GalaxyDoge72/XZChatServer).

Also, don't use this for anything that you want to keep private. This chat thing isn't encrypted at all because I'm too fucking stupid to figure out how to use AES.

This requires the Pillow library to function.

You can install it by running the following command:

`pip install Pillow`
